# Hello judges!

We are "Awesome Team !!1!", very creative, and we are proud to present our project.

As you see, there's quite a bit of files here, so here is an easy list to show you what's what:

**"README.md"** is the readme, which is the file you're reading now.

**"Journeymap.png"** is our journeymap, showing how a user would interact with our product.

**"UI design.pptx"** is the powerpoint presentation showing you the planned UI of the chatbot.

Enjoy our project and happy judging!
